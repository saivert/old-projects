; This is an example language file that is to be used as the
; basis for a new translation. It is not used by Alert Timer.
; The english strings are built into the Alert Timer application.
[LanguageFile]
; Language files are automatically found and loaded
; by Alert timer. The language file that is used depends
; on the language of the Windows installation.
; If you have a Greek version of Windows and Alert Timer
; finds a language file with the LangCode of 1032, then
; this language file will be used. The actual filename of
; the language file is not significant, but it is a good
; habit to name it properly such as greek.lng.
; If no appropriate language file is found then English is
; used by default.

; You don't have to write anything here, it is not required.
; But if you like to advertise for yourself, then this is a
; good place to do so.
