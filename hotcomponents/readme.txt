These are Delphi VCL components required by some of my other projects in the old-projects repository.

Most notable:
TNxSTray - Tray icons made easy
TXPAbout - A Windows XP Style About box
TNxSXPMainMenu - Office XP style menus using owner drawn menus
TNxSFormResizeGrid - Granular resize
TNxSBrowseFolderDlg - SHBrowseForFolder wrapper
THotLabel - URL anchor like label

Includes a sample app for TNxSTray
