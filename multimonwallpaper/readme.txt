This tool is used to create one huge wallpaper from your image files.

You need to add as many images as you have monitors. It will then lay them out according to your multimon layout so they fit right in case you have monitors of varying dimensions.

Still works on Windows 10 but generates images with reduced color pallette for some reason.
